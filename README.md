# 🧠 Building Real-World JavaScript – One Tiny Feature at a Time

## 💡 What’s This?

So here’s the deal:

I’m **not** building a full project right away.  
I’m building **real-world features** one by one — like those little things we always _assume_ we know (spoiler: we don’t).

Think:

- A login form that _actually_ checks something
- A password field that lets you **see** your password (no more typing "12345" five times)
- Form validations that go, “Nope, not today.”
- Local storage magic
- API calls that don’t crash on first fetch
- And more chaotic-neutral frontend experiments

---

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- 🧱 HTML (just enough to hold things together)
- 🎨 CSS (for when I remember it exists)
- ⚙️ JavaScript (Vanilla, plain, not React-flavored… yet)

## 🗂️ Folder Structure (AKA: My Daily Struggles)

```bash
Building-Real-World-JavaScript/
├── day01-login-form/
│   └── index.html, style.css, script.js
├── day02-form-validation/
│   └── slightly_angrier_script.js
├── day03-password-toggle/
│   └── no_more_blind_typing.js
...


Each day = one small feature.
Each folder = one step closer to frontend world domination.
Each bug = my 13th reason 🥲

🔄 Daily Plan (a.k.a. GitHub Therapy)
I push one thing daily. Doesn’t have to be fancy.
Doesn’t have to be perfect.
It just has to exist.

“Done is better than perfect… unless it's your password validator.”

✨ Why I’m Doing This
Because consistency beats cramming

Because YouTube tutorials don’t write code for you

Because job interviews won’t wait for your "perfect" side project

Because GitHub contributions look prettier in green 💚

🗣️ Wanna Watch Me Struggle?
Stick around.
Star the repo.
Steal some code.
Laugh at my CSS.
It's all public for a reason 😅

🧃 Bonus
No frameworks

No build tools

No BS

Just Real HTML + Real CSS + Real JS + Real Pain™

📌 Upcoming Features (If I don’t rage quit)
Dark mode toggle 🌚

LocalStorage wizardry

Weather app (because why not)

Search bars that actually search

Offline to-do list

Modal popups that don’t break everything
```
